<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Rice and soups are staples in Colombian cuisine and today's recipe mixes the two. Chicken rice soup is one of my favorites. We Colombians eat bananas with some soups and believe it or not, it is delicious, try it!

    This Chicken Rice Soup has a wonderful consistency and is delicious.

    Enjoy!
