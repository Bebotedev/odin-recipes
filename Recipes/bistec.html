<h2>Desciption</h2>
<p> 
    This is one of those recipes that many Colombians grew up eating at least once a week. Criolla Steak is one of my favorite dishes because I love the flavor and texture of the Criolla sauce.

<p>
    Colombian Creole Steak is a very simple and quick recipe to make and full of flavor. Serve with white rice and avocado.
